# nuQLOUD - NUclear-based Quantification of Local Organisation via cellUlar Distributions
Repository containing tools to generate organisational features of point clouds. Uses Voronoi diagrams and kernel density estimations to describe the arrangement of local point-neighbourhoods in an object centred way (the object being individual points of the cloud).

This framework currently requires a custom version of voro++ (can be found here https://github.com/max-brambach/voro) for the generation of the Voronoi diagram. This can be swapped out of course, but is currently not implemented.
